<h3>About the BETTER study</h3>
<p>The study aims at developing a Bayesian alternative procedure to improve the performance of vaccine safety surveillance. Empirical evaluations based on large-scale observational healthcare databases are conducted to compare the proposed procedure against the state-of-art approach, MaxSPRT, in terms of testing-oriented and estimation-oriented metrics. </p>

<p>These results are being shared as part of OHDSI's open science community efforts. 
Until final publication, all results are to be considered preliminary and subject to change, and may only be used under the terms of use of the respective data partner contributors.</p>
